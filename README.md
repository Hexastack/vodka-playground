# vodka-playground

This is an experimental playground for building a JS reactive framework that would use native WebComponents.

Goal: Have a simple framework that does not require developers to learn something new in syntax nor add 3rd party library that may impact performance.

Have fun !

## Contribute 

Just clone the repo and `npm i && npm run start`

## Roadmap

This is a POC, we will create a new repo for this framework once we're sure that this will be leading us somewhere.
